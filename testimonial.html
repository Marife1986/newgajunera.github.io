            <ul>As a teacher, I truly believe that learning is a continuous process. This journey of learning has given me a chance to leverage my knowledge and skills, which will advance the career that I am pursuing. I find this training beneficial not only for me but also for my students.   
            </ul>
            <ul>The first sessions of our training had taken me back to the basics of ICT that I needed to review to strengthen the foundation of my new knowledge. I was delighted to know that learning new things in ICT could be fun and exciting. The instructors were accommodating and well-versed, making the learning easy and enjoyable.
            </ul>
            <ul>Moreover, Miss Phoebe Ruth Alithea B. Sudaria, our instructor on one of my favorite topics, spreadsheets, has really exerted her best effort to teach us their function and their importance. I was amazed, as this topic is really important for us teachers because it would make our work more efficient and faster. 
            </ul>
            <ul>Furthermore, Sir Walter Cariaga discussed an interesting lesson about creating a simple web page. For me, it was like opening a new portal where I could create something amazing that would showcase myself, my work experiences, and the services that I could provide for a client if ever I decided to work online.
            </ul>
            <ul>In totality, this ICT training made me realize that learning will come even to those who consider themselves too old to be trained. The instructorsâ€™ patience and persistence in teaching us are praiseworthy. They made this whole experience worth reminiscing. I am grateful to be part of this training and learn a very useful skill. I hope that Northern Bukidnon State College will continue this kind of extension project to help our community be better.
